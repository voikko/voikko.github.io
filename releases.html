    <ul><li>Note that you now need to use voikkovfstc from libvoikko 4.0.2 to create weighted
    VFST transducers. Earlier versions are not compatible anymore. Unweighted transducers
    (those used for Finnish) are still compatible across versions >= 4.0.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Many small performance improvements have been made in various parts of the library.
Their combined effect is most visible when Finnish gammar checker is used. It is about
25&nbsp;% faster than in version 4.0.1.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Libvoikko 4.0.1 (2016-02-04)</h2>
<p>After version 4.0 the following notable changes have been made:</p>
<ul>

 <li>LibreOffice SDK is not needed anymore for building the extension.</li>
 <li>Single extension may support multiple platforms (such as 32 and 64 bit LibreOffice on Windows).</li>
 <li>The libvoikko Python module needs to be packaged with the extension or installed separately through operating
 system package manager.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Support for spell checkers for languages that do not have the basic locale data in LibreOffice has been added.
You can enter the BCP 47 language tag for your language in the LibreOffice character format dialog even if it is

<h2>Libvoikko 4.0 (2015-12-14)</h2>
<p>After version 3.8 the following notable changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finnish VFST backend (dictionary format 5) is now stable and ready for production use. It is the recommended backend to be used for Finnish language.</li>
<li>Previously only Malaga backend (dictionary format 2) was enabled by default. Now we enable HFST (dictionary format 3)
and Finnish VFST (dictionary format 5) instead.</li>
<li>The default dictionary path used as a last resort location to look for dictionary files is no longer set by default.
It is still recommended to set a default dictionary path on systems where it is useful: <kbd>--with-dictionary-path=/usr/lib/voikko</kbd></li>
<li>In the default build configuration it is now possible to use and distribute the libvoikko library under MPL 1.1 / GPL 2+ / LGPL 2.1+ tri-license.</li>

<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.19 (2015-10-09)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later for building. For use with Voikko, libvoikko
2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.18 the following notable changes
have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>New words have been added and various bugs in morphological analysis have been fixed.</li>
<li>The experimental VFST morphology is now feature complete and ready for beta testing. Libvoikko 3.8
is needed for using it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mozvoikko 2.2 (2015-09-14)</h2>
<p>This version requires libvoikko 3.1 or later. It is compatible with Firefox versions 4.0
or later and Thunderbird 5.0 or later. Significant changes in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>All languages known to Voikko are supported for spell checking, not
   just Finnish.</li>
<li>Mechanism for loading shared library dependencies has been added. If
   libvoikko cannot be loaded the extension will try to load the listed
   dependencies and then attempt to load libvoikko again. This makes it
   possible to deliver hfstospell and its dependencies as shared libraries.</li>
<li>Separete README.user to be included in the xpi extension. Plain README
   caused confusion since it is targeted to developers.</li>
<li>In addition to the traditional source code release the extension is provided as an
   XPI extension signed by Mozilla. This can be used to satisfy the new extension
   signature requirement in the upcoming Firefox versions. No binary components are
   included in this signed package, they must be provided by the operating system.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.8 (2015-09-11)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4 or later. Some features require Suomi-malaga 1.12
or later. After version 3.7.1 the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionary path specified at compile time, through VOIKKO_DICTIONARY_PATH or
  through Windows registry keys can now contain more than one directory.
  Separator character is ";" on Windows and ":" on other platforms (so this
  works now just as regular PATH environment variable).</li>
<li>BCP 47 scripts subtags are now supported:
  <ul>
  <li>Four letter script subtag can now be appended when requesting a dictionary
    for specific language. This should only be used when more than one script
    is actually used for a language since libvoikko does not know what the
    "default" script for any specific language is.</li>
  <li>New API function voikko_dict_script has been added.</li>
  <li>Script attribute has also been added to Python and Java Dictionary objects</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>HFST backend code has been re-licensed under GPL/LGPL/MPL (hfstospell itself
  is under the Apache license).</li>
<li>Lots of improvements related to VFST format:
  <ul>
  <li>A new weighted variant of VFST format has been added. This variant also
    supports larger transducers with more symbols and states than the
    unweighted variant.</li>
  <li>Language independent "simple" VFST spellers now use weighted transducers
    and support spelling suggestions that are sorted using the weight
    information from the transducers. Finnish VFST format (format 5) continues
    to use unweighted transducer format.</li>
  <li>Finnish VFST format now reads grammar checker autocorrect data from a
    transducer instead of using built-in autocorrect data shipped with
    libvoikko. The autocorrect data within libvoikko is still included if
    Malaga backend is enabled but it is only used for grammar checking with
    Malaga dictionaries (format 2).</li>
  <li>Support for WORDIDS and WORDBASES attributes has been added to Finnish
    VFST format.</li>
  <li>Dictionary format 5 has reached feature parity with format 2 and is now
    good enough to be used for beta testing.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Various small improvements have been made in Finnish grammar checker and
  morphological analysis.</li>
<li>Extended support for character sets affecting at least Plains Cree written
  in Canadian syllabics, Skolt Sami and Romanian.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that appeared when the library was used within 64 bit Firefox
  on Windows.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.18 (2015-01-28)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later for building. For use with Voikko, libvoikko

on PPC OS X and updated web site address.</p>


<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.17 (2014-08-24)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later for building. For use with Voikko, libvoikko
2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.16 the following notable changes
have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>New words have been added and various bugs have been fixed.</li>
<li>Grammar checking rules have been relaxed after recent decision from Finnish Language Board to allow "alkaa tekemään".</li>
<li>The VFST morphology for Finnish is usable for hyphenation and language checking.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.16 (2014-03-09)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later for building. For use with Voikko, libvoikko
2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.15 the following notable changes
have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>New words have been added and various bugs have been fixed.</li>
<li>The VFST morphology for Finnish is now nearly complete and already usable for many purposes.</li>
<li>Syntax of WORDBASES attribute has been changed slightly. It now exposes the internal structure
of pre-composed compound words. In previous versions this information has only been present in the
STRUCTURE attribute.<br />
This change has no effect on applications that use the standard dictionary since
it does not provide WORDBASES at all. Applications that use custom dictionaries and parse the WORDBASES
attribute may need to be updated to handle the newly added boundary markers. The added boundary marker
can be observed by analysing the word "amerikankurmitsa":
<kbd>WORDBASES=+amerikankurmitsa(amerikan=kurmitsa)</kbd> ("=" was not present in the earlier releases).</li>
</ul>

OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 or later. Notable changes in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>New icon</li>
<li>Show links for extended grammar checker help texts. Links are only shown in LibreOffice 3.5
or later.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.4.1 (2012-01-28)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4 or later. Some features require Suomi-malaga 1.10
or later. This is a maintenance release that contains mostly build fixes for MSVC and
GCC 4.7.</p>


<h2>Mozvoikko 2.0.1 (2012-01-04)</h2>
<p>This version requires libvoikko 3.0 or later. It is compatible with Firefox versions 4.0
or later and Thunderbird 5.0 or later.</p>
<p>This release fixes a bug that prevented changing spell checking language to anything else
than Finnish in Firefox 9. Link to extension home page has also been updated.</p>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.4 (2011-12-17)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4 or later. Some features require Suomi-malaga 1.10
or later. After version 3.3.1 the following notable changes have been made:</p>

</ul>


<h2>Mozvoikko 2.0 (2011-10-10)</h2>
<p>This version requires libvoikko 3.0 or later. It is compatible with Firefox versions 4.0 - 8.0
and Thunderbird 5.0 - 8.0.</p>
<p>Mozvoikko 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Mozvoikko
in JavaScript. Binary version of libvoikko (shipped with the extension or installed
as a part of the operating system) is still needed but Mozvoikko itself contains no
C++ code and thus no longer needs to be compiled. It is expected that Mozvoikko 2.0
will require fewer compatibility updates for new Firefox versions than Mozvoikko 1.x did.
Future compatibility cannot be guaranteed and thus it is still assumed that
distributors of this component test new Firefox versions as they are released and
change the range of compatible versions accordingly.</p>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.3.1 (2011-09-26)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4 or later. Some features require Suomi-malaga 1.10
or later.</p>
<p>This is a bug fix release that fixes a crash seen in recent versions of Firefox.
The bug was introduced in libvoikko 3.1. No separate bug fix release will be made for libvoikko
3.1 or 3.2 but the <a href="http://voikko.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/voikko/trunk/libvoikko/src/spellchecker/FinnishSpellerTweaksWrapper.cpp?r1=3855&amp;r2=4015&amp;view=patch">patch</a>
will apply to these versions as well.</p>


<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.10 (2011-09-16)</h2>

2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.9 the following notable changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>New words have been added. Most new words are either geographical names or special
vocabulary for mathematics and physics.</li>
<li>Many errors in morphological analysis have been fixed and new attributes are exported
for use in libvoikko. Taking advantage of some of these features requires libvoikko 3.3
or later.</li>
<li>Improved handling of compound words containing foreign components.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.3 (2011-09-16)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4 or later. Some features require Suomi-malaga 1.10
or later. After version 3.2.1 the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<p>This version requires libvoikko 3.0 or later. It works with any version of LibreOffice and
OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 or later. Notable changes in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>The software has been renamed from openoffice.org-voikko to libreoffice-voikko. The new
name is more convenient for most of our distributors who now target LibreOffice instead of
OpenOffice.org. The extension still works with both office suites.</li>
<li>"Ignore all" works for individual grammar checker rules in Spelling and Grammar dialog.</li>
<li>Spell checking is supported for up to 74 different languages. The actual number depends on
how libvoikko has been configured and which morphologies  are available.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.1 (2010-11-19)</h2>

2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.6 the following notable changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>New words have been added, especially from medical field.</li>
<li>Internal data structures have been optimized to reduce memory footprint by 10&nbsp;% and
increase lookup performance by about 4&nbsp;%.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Openoffice.org-voikko 3.1.2 (2010-08-05)</h2>
<p>This version requires libvoikko 2.1 or later, and OpenOffice.org 3.0.1
or later. This release contains a fix for a bug that prevents
OpenOffice.org 3.3 from starting up if a previous version of this
extension is installed. Additionally this release supports the license
dialog bypass feature of unopkg in OpenOffice.org 3.3.</p>


<h2>Libvoikko 3.0 (2010-05-27)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4 or later. After version 2.3.1
the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>New thread safe API has been added that allows unlimited number of
dictionaries to be opened and used simultaneously. In order to maintain
compatibility with previous versions the old API is still available.
It is now possible to open up to four dictionaries using the old API but
this is not completely thread safe and therefore not recommended. Defining
macro VOIKKO_NO_DEPRECATED_API before including voikko.h disables
most of the old API and can be used to help porting the applications to
the new API. The macro should not be used in released software.</li>
<li>BCP 47 language tags are used to identify languages and language
variants in the new API. Only Finnish (with variants) is supported in
this release but many changes have been made that will eventually allow
adding support for other languages.</li>
<li>Experimental Lttoolbox backend has been added and HFST backend has
been improved.</li>
<li>Hyphenator and spelling suggestion code has been reworked to support
alternative implementations.</li>
<li>Option VOIKKO_OPT_IGNORE_NUMBERS no longer affect spelling suggestions,
just spell checking.</li>
<li>Deprecated option VOIKKO_OPT_ENCODING is now ignored. It never worked
consistently across different platforms and names of acceptable encodings
were not documented. UTF-8 is now the only supported narrow character
string encoding. With this change dependency on iconv has been removed.</li>
<li>Option VOIKKO_INTERSECT_COMPOUND_LEVEL is now ignored since implementing
it in alternative hyphenators would have been unreasonably difficult. The
option was not known to be used in any application and ignoring it does
not affect hyphenation results in a significant way.</li>
<li>Various improvements have been made in grammar checker. Most notably
number of false positives from capitalization checks should be reduced.</li>
<li>Testing tools have been improved. On platforms that support Posix threads
voikkospell can take advantage of multiple CPU cores to significantly
improve processing times for large lists of input words.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.6 (2010-05-16)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later for building. For use with Voikko, libvoikko
2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.5 the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4. Version 2.2.1 fixes some
bugs found in version 2.2 and improves compatibility with Windows.</p>


<h2>Libvoikko 2.2 (2009-09-30)</h2>
<p>This version requires Suomi-malaga 1.4. After version 2.1
the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Libvoikko now includes an simplified implementation of Malaga. The
Malaga library is no longer needed for building or running libvoikko.
Glib, which was previously indirectly used through Malaga, is now used
directly and thus still required. This change was done to fix symbol name
clashes between libmalaga and applications that were linked with libvoikko.</li>
<li>Spell checking and hyphenation operations are about 15&nbsp;% faster than
with libvoikko 2.1.</li>
<li>Logic for generating spelling suggestions has been improved. Suggestions that
were previously not found can now be found and ordering of the returned suggestions
is calculated more intelligently.</li>
<li>API has been added for morphological analysis. Analysis results are returned as
sets of key-value pairs. The set of keys and the format of corresponding values may
change in the future releases. Currently some features such as the base form of the
word are available only if debug version of Suomi-malaga is used.</li>
<li>Python bindings have been added. The bindings work with Python 2.5 or later (not with Python 3.x).
The underlying implementation uses ctypes module and therefore no native code is
needed in addition to the platform dependent libvoikko library. The interface offered
by libvoikko Python module is much easier to use than the corresponding C library
interface.</li>
<li>Additionally small bug fixes and improvements have been made in various parts of
the library.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Suomi-malaga 1.4 (2009-09-30)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later for building. For use with Voikko, libvoikko
2.2 or later is needed. After version 1.3 the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dictionary data structures have been compacted, leading to about 10&nbsp;% smaller
runtime files for Voikko.</li>
<li>Dictionary format has been changed for Voikko. The new format exports more information
about the morphology of analyzed words. The format is not compatilble with libvoikko 2.1
or earlier.</li>
<li>More words have been added and some bugs have been fixed.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Openoffice.org-voikko 3.1 (2009-04-28)</h2>
<p>This version requires libvoikko 2.1 or later, and OpenOffice.org 3.0.1
or later. After version 3.0 the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grammar checker is now enabled by default.</li>
<li>Option for specifying whether unknown words should be hyphenated has
been added.</li>
<li>Vocabulary variant can now be selected from the options dialog.</li>

building on that platform.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mozvoikko 1.0 (2009-04-28)</h2>
<p>This version requires libvoikko 1.7 or later. Older
versions of libvoikko can also be used, but quality of spell checking
will be reduced. This version is compatible with Firefox versions 3.0 - 3.5.
After version 0.9.6 changes have been made to make the extension compatible with
OS X and future versions of Mozilla products.</p>


<h2>Libvoikko 2.1 (2009-04-28)</h2>
<p>This version requires malaga 7.8 or later and Suomi-malaga 1.3.
Suomi-malaga versions 0.7.3 - 1.2 may also be used, but performance and
quality of grammar checking will be significantly worse. After version 2.0
the following notable changes have been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internal implementation language has been changed from C to C++.
This should not affect the users of the library, since exported interface
continues to use C ABI.</li>
<li>Ability to specify non-default dictionary variant and list available
dictionary variants has been added.</li>
<li>Directory layout for linguistic resources has been changed. The new
layout allows multiple dictionary variants and versions to be installed
simultaneously.</li>
<li>New option VOIKKO_OPT_HYPHENATE_UNKNOWN_WORDS has been added to allow
controlling whether words that are not recognised in morphological analysis
should be hyphenated.</li>
<li>New options VOIKKO_OPT_ACCEPT_UNFINISHED_PARAGRAPHS_IN_GC and
VOIKKO_OPT_ACCEPT_BULLETED_LISTS_IN_GC have been added. They can be used to
relax grammar checking rules in situations that commonly occur in word
processing applications.</li>

<div class="suomi" lang="fi" xml:lang="fi">
<h2>Versio 1.2</h2>
<p>Versio 1.2 julkaistiin 15.11.2006, ja se koostuu seuraavista komponenteista:</p>
<ul>
<li>libvoikko 1.2</li>
<li>Suomi-malaga 0.7.3 (”Voikko edition”)</li>
<li>openoffice.org-voikko 1.2</li>
<li>tmispell-voikko 0.6.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tämä versio vaatii toimiakseen malagan version 7.8 tai uudemman.</p>

<h3>Käyttäjän kannalta merkittävät muutokset</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vierasperäisten sanojen, yhdyssanojen ja tiettyjen poikkeavasti tavuttuvien sanojen tavutusta
on parannettu.</li>
<li>Isojen kirjainten käyttöä on tarkennettu ja korjailtu.</li>
<li>Tunnistettavaa nimistöä on laajennettu: lähes kaikki Suomen kunnat sekä monet aikaisemmin
tunnistamatta jääneet yleiset etu- ja sukunimet tunnistuvat oikein.</li>
<li>Etuliitteiden ja lyhyiden nominien käyttöä yhdyssanoissa on rajoitettu, minkä johdosta
vääriä korjausehdotuksia annetaan vähemmän ja väärin kirjoitettujen sanojen havaitseminen
helpottuu.</li>
<li>Joitakin virheellisiä ja murteellisia taivutusmuotoja ei enää hyväksytä.</li>
<li>Sanastoon on lisätty sanoja ja virheellisiä sanoja on poistettu.</li>
<li>Tmispell-voikko toimii KDE:ssa myös käyttäjillä, joiden oletusmerkistö on jokin muu kuin 
UTF-8.</li>
<li>Libvoikko tarkistaa käytettävän Suomi-malagan version ja kieltäytyy käyttämästä
epäyhteensopivaa versiota.</li>
<li>Oo2-voikon nimi on vaihdettu openoffice.org-voikoksi vastaamaan Linux-jakeluiden
yleistä käytäntöä.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ohjelmistonkehittäjien ja tehokäyttäjien kannalta merkittävät muutokset</h3>
<ul>
<li>Libvoikko sallii sovelluskohtaisen sanastohakemiston määrittämisen alustusfunktion
voikko_init_with_path avulla.</li>
<li>Suomi-malagassa on alustava tuki hyväksyttävien taivutusmuotojen hienosäädölle ja
omien lisäsanastojen käytölle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Versio 1.1</h2>
<p>Versio 1.1 julkaistiin 14.9.2006, ja se koostuu seuraavista komponenteista:</p>
<ul>
<li>libvoikko 1.1</li>
<li>Suomi-malaga 0.7.2 (”Voikko edition”)</li>
<li>Oo2-voikko 1.1</li>
<li>tmispell-voikko 0.6.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tämä versio vaatii toimiakseen malagan version 7.4 tai uudemman.</p>

<h3>Käyttäjän kannalta merkittävät muutokset</h3>
<ul>
<li>Versiossa 1.0 monikäsitteisistä yhdyssanoista (esimerkiksi ”kaivosaukko”) pystyi rakentamaan merkkijonoja,
joiden oikoluku ja tavutus vei niin paljon prosessoriaikaa, että libvoikkoa käyttävät ohjelmat käytännöllisesti
katsoen jumiutuivat. Tämä on korjattu laskemalla käsiteltävien sanojen pituusrajaa 255 merkistä 59 merkkiin.
Samantapaisia ongelmia esiintyy myös muissa oikolukuohjelmissa. Olemme testanneet seuraavat ohjelmat:
  <dl><dt id="soikko111bug">Soikko</dt><dd>
    Soikon jaettu kirjasto kärsii tästä samasta ongelmasta: siinä ei sanojen pituudelle ole nähtävästi mitään ylärajaa.
    Ongelma on korjattu ainakin Oo2-soikon versiossa 1.1.2, jossa ylärajaksi on asetettu 74 merkkiä. Jos käytät muuta
    Soikon sisältävää oikolukuohjelmaa tai -komponenttia kuin Oo2-soikkoa, kysy ohjelman tekijältä, koskeeko ongelma myös
    kyseistä ohjelmaa.
  </dd><dt>hunspell</dt><dd>
    Hunspellin jaetussa kirjastossa sanojen pituus on rajoitettu noin 100 merkkiin. Siispä kirjastoa käyttävät ohjelmat
    eivät automaattisesti kärsi tästä ongelmasta, mutta Hunspellin komentorivityökalu (versio 1.1.4) kaatuu, jos
    siihen syötetään yli 100 merkkiä pitkiä merkkijonoja.
  </dd><dt>ispell ja myspell</dt><dd>
    Näissä on noin 100 merkin yläraja käsiteltävien sanojen pituudelle, eikä niissä näytä olevan tätä ongelmaa.
  </dd><dt>Microsoft Word</dt><dd>
    Wordin suomen kielen oikoluku näyttäisi rajoittavan oikoluettavien sanojen pituuden noin 60 merkkiin. Tätä pidemmät
    sanat hyväksytään aina oikeiksi. Word ei siis kärsi tästä ongelmasta.
  </dd></dl></li>
<li>OpenOffice.orgissa oikolukudialogin kautta tehtävä oikoluku on korjattu.</li>
<li>Väärin kirjoitettujen sanojen korjausehdotuksia on korjattu.</li>
<li>Lisätty tuki erinäisille vaihtoehtoisille Unicode-merkeille ja merkkiyhdistelmille oikoluvussa.</li>
<li>Pieni määrä virheellisesti hyväksyttyjä taivutuksia on korjattu.</li>
<li>Lisätty tuki tyyppiä mAinen (”koiramainen”) ja lAinen (”jyväskyläläinen”) oleville johdoksille.</li>
<li>Tmispell-voikon interaktiivinen käyttöliittymä on saatavissa suomenkielisenä.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ohjelmistonkehittäjien kannalta merkittävät muutokset</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oo2-voikko ja tmispell-voikko eivät enää käytä ohjelmakirjastojen avaamiseen dlopen/dlsym -kutsuja vaan
normaalia käännösaikaista dynaamista linkitystä.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Versio 1.0</h2>
<p>Voikon ensimmäinen vakaa versio 1.0 julkaistiin 13.8.2006, ja se koostuu seuraavista komponenteista:</p>
<ul>
<li>libvoikko 1.0</li>
<li>Suomi-malaga 0.7.1 (”Voikko edition”)</li>
<li>Oo2-voikko 1.0</li>
