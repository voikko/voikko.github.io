<h1>Voikko<br /><small>General architecture</small></h1>

<p>Voikko consists of a set of separately released components that form a
stack of layers as illustrated in the picture below.</p>

<p><img src="images/architecture.png" style="border: 1px solid black" alt="General architecture of Voikko" /></p>

<p>In this project we develop the components shown with blue background, and
some of the components with yellow background:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>libvoikko</dt>
  <dd>Libvoikko is the high level library that contains among other things
   algorithms that generate spelling suggestions and perform rule based
   hyphenation. It is also capable of caching the results of common spell
   checking operations to improve performance. All of the grammar checking
   is also done within libvoikko. Recent versions of libvoikko contain built
   in implementation of Malaga parser, but earlier versions used the separate
   Malaga library.
   The library source contains small command line test tools and Python bindings
   to the library.</dd>
  <dt>Suomi-malaga</dt>
  <dd>Suomi-malaga is a description of Finnish morphology implemented with Malaga.
   It was designed by Hannu Väisänen for text indexing and therefore accepted many
   common spelling mistakes and historical word forms that should be rejected when
   doing spell checking. For this reason, Voikko originally used its own branch of
   Suomi-malaga, with version numbers matching 0.7.X. Now the versions have
   been merged, and Suomi-malaga 1.0 and later can be used to build a morphology
   suitable for spell checking and text indexing from the same source package.</dd>
  <dt>libreoffice-voikko</dt>
  <dd>Libreoffice-voikko is an LibreOffice extension that uses Voikko to provide
   Finnish spell checking, hyphenation and grammar checking.</dd>
  <dt>Enchant Voikko plugin</dt>
  <dd>Voikko provider plugin for multi-backend Enchant spell checker library
   is included in Enchant version 1.4 and later.</dd>
  <dt>tmispell-voikko</dt>
  <dd>Tmispell-voikko is an ispell compatible spell checker that uses Voikko to provide
   Finnish spell checking and falls back to real ispell for other languages. Tmispell-voikko
   was originally written by Pauli Virtanen for the freely distributable but closed source
   spell checker Soikko. Tmispell-voikko also contains an Enchant provider plugin for
   Enchant version 1.3. Tmispell-voikko is deprecated and not actively developed
   anymore. Developers using ispell to add spell checking capability in their
   applications should consider switching to Enchant instead.</dd>
  <dt>Joukahainen</dt>
  <dd>Joukahainen is our web application used to maintain the vocabulary. Joukahainen is
   designed to store and provide vocabulary data in an application independent format which
   should make it easier to use and experiment with the data outside the Voikko project.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Upstream version of <a href="http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/">Malaga</a> by
Björn Beutel is used to compile and debug Suomi-malaga. The Malaga implementation
within libvoikko is also based on original Malaga, but it has been modified to make
it more suitable for our purposes.</p>

<h2>The reasons for using malaga instead of Hunspell</h2>
<p>This project started in late 2005 under the name Hunspell-fi, with an aim to create
Finnish vocabulary and affix files for Hunspell. The Hunspell based implementation was developed
roughly six months, and there were no serious problems but it was also evident that the
work progressed rather slowly. In early 2006 Hannu Väisänen published Suomi-malaga, which
contained a vocabulary that was (depending on how one defines "word") roughly ten times
larger than the Hunspell-fi vocabulary at that time. Additionally the Hunspell-fi implementation
did not support compound words and only a few derived word forms, which were both supported
by Suomi-malaga.</p>
<p>Suomi-malaga had a lot of correctness problems from the spellchecking point of
view that did not exist in our Finnish Hunspell dictionary, but with the limited resources
we had at that time we really could not afford ignoring the huge amount of work that had
gone into producing Suomi-malaga. Using the vocabulary of Suomi-malaga in Hunspell was not
possible due to different semantics of word classification between these projects.
It would be somewhat easier now that the data has been moved to Joukahainen and the classification
has been modernised.</p>
<p>There are still some problems with the malaga based approach that might not exist in
Hunspell. Malaga is not thread safe (this is going to be fixed within libvoikko), and the performance is sufficient but not great.
Writing an accurate Finnish morphology with malaga is not easy, but there are currently
only a few cases (mostly involving inflection within compound words) where no satisfactory
solution has been found yet. However it is unlikely that Hunspell is any better in this
regard. The COMPOUNDRULE patterns in Hunspell would make some things easier that are
somewhat complicated to do with Malaga, but there are other major limitations
(or at least there have been, some may have been fixed in recent versions) in Hunspell that
should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunspell only supports two consecutive suffixes for any word. This is of course a
major improvement compared to ispell or myspell that supported only one. But in Finnish
it is common to have three or more suffixes in a word. This requires merging of
suffixes and in practice some sort of tool has to be created to generate these merged
forms (apparently this method has been used in Hungarian Hunspell dictionaries, so it
is possible). This makes it is impossible to write Hunspell affix files manually and
adds another layer of complexity to the system. Of course having such tool and storing
morphological rules in an application independent format would help converting to other
formats later, which would be a good thing.</li>
<li>Hunspell has methods for allowing or forbidding certain inflected or derived forms
in compounds. But binary allow/forbid is not enough, we need a method for specifying
compound rules by word class and then specifying that certain derivational suffixes
cause the word to belong to a different class. And this must work recursively
(derived words can be derived too) for at least three levels. Additionally words can
be inflected (in a restricted way) inside compounds too, so this must be supported
as well.</li>
<li>Hunspell seems to need a lot more memory than malaga, especially when multiple
instances are used on the same machine. The total running set size for libvoikko and its
dictionary is about 9 megabytes shared + 0.5 megabytes data per running instance.
Hunspell (Hungarian) consumes 1 megabytes shared + 15 megabytes data per instance.
This would still be acceptable for single user systems, but in a classroom LTSP
server with 20 pupils using LibreOffice the total memory use would be
about 20 megabytes with Voikko and 300 megabytes with Hunspell. If they used
Firefox with spell checking extension at the same time, the numbers would become
30 megabytes for Voikko and 600 megabytes for Hunspell. Using precompiled binary
dictionaries and mmap, or a spelling server would fix this problem in Hunspell, but the
server solution would cause additional security and maintenance issues for the
administrator.</li>
<li>Voikko is not just a spell checking library. It currently provides grammar checker,
hyphenator and string tokeniser as well. Additionally Voikko has many extra options
related to spell checking not found in Hunspell, such as special suggestion mode
for fixing errors introduced during optical character recognition.
Some of these would make sense in
Hunspell as well and could be ported there if needed. But other features
(such as hyphenator and grammar checker) would need to be designed differently to make them
language independent for Hunspell. Totally separating hyphenator and spell checker
(as is currently done in most free tools except Voikko) does
not make sense, since both rely on morphological analysis for their operation.<br />
Hunspell has morphological analysis features too, but they may not be on
the same level of stability as the rest of the library. Testing
version 1.2.2 still crashes when using the analyze command, whereas malaga
has not had a single crash bug found from in its LAG parser during the past
three years we have been using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the problems above could definitely be solved within Hunspell, but
migh require a lot of work.
Compromising quality just to become compatible with Hunspell is not an option,
because Finnish people have come to expect really good results from their
spell checkers (we have had advanced compound word checking in commercial text
editors for well over ten years).</p>
<p>Currently work is going on to port the Finnish Malaga morphology into finite state form.
Voikko already supports some finite state backends for various languages. Once all of
our supported formats are finite state and compatible with Hunspell licensing it
will be possible to consider merging the code.</p>

<h2>How to distribute Voikko</h2>

<p>The core parts of Voikko are all hidden behind the public interface of libvoikko,
which is designed to be distributed as a shared library and used by any number of
applications in the operating system. Our goal is to get the software shipped
as a part of various Linux distributions so that Finnish writing aids would work
out of the box for anyone who needs them. In the best case users would not even
know that they are using Voikko. The source packages released by us should be suitable
for easy packaging in different distributions (if not, tell us and we try to improve
them). Just make sure that you package a compatible set of modules.</p>

<p>Note that currently the interface between libvoikko and Suomi-malaga is not
considered to be fully stable, although it has remained unchanged for quite long
time. We still have some requirements left that cannot be implemented without
changing this interface. We will do our best to make libvoikko handle missing
or incorrect versions of Suomi-malaga lexicon files as gracefully as possible.
We however think that binary packages of libvoikko should have a dependency on
binary packge of Suomi-malaga (commonly called voikko-fi) since the library
is essentially useless without it.</p>

<p>The suggestion above implies that the Enchant provider plugin should not be
distributed in the same binary package with Enchant main library, otherwise
the dependency chain will drag Suomi-malaga binaries (the largest component of
Voikko) on almost every Linux desktop on the planet regardless of the installation
language. Luckily the provider plugin can be easily shipped in a separate
package, since Enchant does runtime detection and loading of provider plugins
with dlopen. This way no Voikko specific material gets installed on systems where
Finnish spell checking is not needed.</p>

<p>We do not have official reference packaging available, but Fedora packages of Voikko
follow the guidelines above and could be used as a starting point for packages
for other distributions.</p>

<p>To make the application integration easier, it would be preferable to have an
unified standard interface between linguistic tools and applications using them.
The proposed
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-language-checking-spec">freedesktop.org
Desktop Language Checking Spec</a> is a step to this direction.</p>
<p>For Windows and OS X the packaging may have to be done a bit differently, as neither
of them natively supports software packaged this way. However in OS X one can use similar
third party packaging systems such as Fink and MacPorts.</p>
